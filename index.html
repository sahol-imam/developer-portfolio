            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>Jessore district once belonged to the ancient Janapada of Vanga (বঙ্গ) Janapada. In the 15th century,
                Jessore was a part of the kingdom of Pratapaditya. It was then conquered by the Mughals.

                British administration was finally established in Jessore district in 1781 when the governor-general
                ordered the opening of a court at Murali near Jessore.[5] In 1947, Jessore was divided between India and
                (then) Pakistan. Except for the Bangaon and Gaighata thanas, the district became part of East
                Pakistan.[6]

                The Bengali soldiers stationed at Jessore cantonment mutinied against the Pakistan Army on 29 March
                1971. They were led by Captain Hafiz Uddin and Lieutenant Anwar in an uprising where 300 soldiers were
                killed. The rebels killed 50 Pakistani soldiers with machine gun fire at Chanchara.

                On 6 December 1971, Jessore became the first district of Bengal to be liberated from Pakistani forces.
                And Jessore is the first digital district in Bangladesh.</p>
